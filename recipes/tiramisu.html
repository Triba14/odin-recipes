    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 cups brewed espresso or strong coffee, cooled to room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>24-30 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and continue to whisk constantly until the mixture thickens and becomes pale yellow, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the bowl from the heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the softened mascarpone cheese to the egg mixture and beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until well combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, combine the brewed espresso and coffee liqueur (if using).</li>
        <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture, making sure not to soak them too long, as they can become soggy.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch dish, breaking them if necessary to fit.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the layer of ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <li>Sift cocoa powder over the top of the tiramisu to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the tiramisu for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
        <li>Before serving, dust with additional cocoa powder if desired. <em>Enjoy your homemade tiramisu!</em></li>
    </ol>
