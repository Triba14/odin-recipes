    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a skillet, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions and minced garlic, sautéing until they're soft and fragrant. Then, add sliced mushrooms and cook until they're tender. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, brown the ground meat and Italian sausage until they're cooked through. Drain any excess fat, then add the cooked vegetables back to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</li>
        <strong>Prepare the sauces:</strong>
        <li>In a saucepan, warm the tomato sauce over medium heat. If using homemade sauce, you may want to season it with some Italian herbs like oregano, basil, and thyme.</li>
        <li>In another saucepan, prepare the béchamel sauce. Melt butter over medium heat, whisk in flour to form a roux, then gradually whisk in milk until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the meat and vegetable mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Spoon a layer of béchamel sauce over the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the béchamel sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</li>
        <strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once baked, let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
        <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>
        <li>Garnish the lasagna with fresh basil leaves, if desired, before serving.</li>
        <li>Slice the lasagna into portions and serve hot, accompanied by a crisp green salad and some crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade lasagna, and savor every <em>delicious</em> bite!</p>
